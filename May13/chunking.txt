Chunking is the process of dividing large text or data into smaller, manageable segments called chunks. It is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and data analysis to facilitate more efficient computation and understanding. In the context of text, chunking helps break down documents into coherent pieces that preserve context.

This technique is particularly useful when working with large files like PDFs, research papers, or long articles. Many language models have token limits, making it impossible to process large texts in a single input. Chunking allows these texts to be split and processed incrementally. Overlapping chunks are often used to maintain contextual continuity across sections.

In machine learning, chunking is essential for time series forecasting and sequential modeling. It enables sliding windows over data to train models on patterns that evolve over time. Chunking also aids in summarization tasks, where each chunk is summarized individually before combining results.

Chunking strategies must be carefully designed to avoid breaking sentences or disrupting meaning. Techniques like sentence-based or paragraph-based chunking are used to maintain semantic coherence. It is also relevant in audio and video processing, where continuous data is divided into frames or segments.

Chunking improves efficiency, reduces memory requirements, and enhances model accuracy. In document processing pipelines, it allows for parallel processing and easier debugging. Chunking is also a foundational step in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and knowledge-based AI. In summary, chunking is a vital preprocessing step in modern AI systems that deal with large or continuous data streams.
