Single-Agent RAG:
-----------------
- Architecture:
  A single language model (agent) handles the entire task: querying a retriever, aggregating retrieved data, and generating the response.

- Advantages:
  1. Simplicity: Easier to deploy and manage.
  2. Lower Latency: Fewer steps and components result in faster inference.
  3. Resource Efficiency: Requires fewer compute resources.

- Disadvantages:
  1. Limited Specialization: One model may not excel at all subtasks (retrieval, synthesis, reasoning).
  2. Scalability: Difficult to scale for complex workflows or large corpora.
  3. Less Robust: A single point of failure for all tasks.

Multi-Agent RAG:
----------------
- Architecture:
  Multiple agents (models) with specialized roles (e.g., retriever, summarizer, reasoner) collaborate in a pipeline or iterative workflow.

- Advantages:
  1. Specialization: Each agent is fine-tuned for specific tasks, improving performance.
  2. Modularity: Easy to upgrade or replace components independently.
  3. Scalability: Can handle more complex queries and larger knowledge bases.
  4. Robustness: Distributed responsibilities reduce single points of failure.

- Disadvantages:
  1. Complexity: Requires orchestration logic and communication protocols between agents.
  2. Higher Latency: Multiple agents introduce processing delays.
  3. More Resource Intensive: Demands more compute and memory.

Conclusion:
-----------
Single-agent RAG is ideal for simple or low-latency use cases, while multi-agent RAG is suited for complex, large-scale, or high-accuracy scenarios requiring task-specific reasoning.
